/**
 * Design a system that controls traffic lights with below assumptions:
 *
 * 1.A group of traffic lights has two components: main lights and pedestrian lights.
 * 2.Main traffic lights have three colors: red, yellow and green.
 * 3.Pedestrian lights have two colors: red and green.
 * 4.Pedestrian lights' colors are reversed from main lights:
 * 5.Main: red/yellow - pedestrian's: green
 * 6.Main: green - pedestrian: red
 * 7.There is a button for pedestrian lights if the button is pushed in advance, pedestrian's lights
 *   change colors according to the main ones if the button isn't pushed, pedestrian's lights remain red.
 * 8.A typical junction has 4 groups of lights.
 * 9.Additional question: design the system in a way that allows cars which start from one
 * junction after a red light don't have to stop at the next one.
