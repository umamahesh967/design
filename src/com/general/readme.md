1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

Abstraction is about detail hiding(implementation hiding).

While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data, 
data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.
