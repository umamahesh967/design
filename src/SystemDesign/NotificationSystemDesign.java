 *  * Push Notification vs In-App Message
 *  * There are two types of notifications in mobile applications:
 *  *
 *  * Push notifications –
 *  *   standard mobile notifications that are used most often. These are messages that the user sees without opening the app,
 *  *   typically on the lock screen.
 *  *
 *  * In-app notifications –
 *  *   messages that the user gets inside the application after they have opened it.
 *  *   These notifications are designed to send more targeted and context-sensitive messages.
