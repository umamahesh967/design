/**
 * A content delivery network, or content distribution network, is a geographically distributed
 * network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and
 * performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

 * How to use CDN?
 * There are two ways you can serve data from most CDNs:
 * Using a pull zone:
 *      This pulls existing content from your origin server(like s3 or GCS) and caches it on the CDN's PoPs.
 *
 * Using a push zone:
 *      You manually upload content to the CDNs storage cluster and from there the
 *      content gets distributed to the CDN's PoPs.

 *  Use CDN as a Proxy and Entry Point to the Web Application
 * Another strategy you can employ is to serve the entire web application via the CDN service.
 * Here the CDN also acts as a proxy and the entry point to the web application.
 * For this to work, the CDN should be able to caches the frontend static content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
 * and bypass the dynamic content (API Calls) to the origin.
 *
 * You can use this approach with AWS CloudFront, where you donâ€™t need to define CDN URLs in your index.html explicitly.
 * However, you need to determine the caching rules (TTL) to instruct the CDN proxy for the static and
 * dynamic content based on path-based routing.
