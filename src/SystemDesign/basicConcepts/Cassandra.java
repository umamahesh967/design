/**
 *
 * How does Cassandra work?
 * Cassandra is a peer-to-peer distributed system made up of a cluster of nodes in which any node can
 * accept a read or write request. Similar to Amazonâ€™s Dynamo DB, every node in the cluster communicates
 * state information about itself and other nodes using the peer-to-peer gossip communication protocol.
 *
 *
 * It is a AP(CAP Theorem) database.
