 * @Cassandra is typically classified as an AP system, meaning that availability and
 * partition tolerance are generally considered to be more important than consistency.
 *
 * Cassandra is based on distributed system architecture. In its simplest form,
 * Cassandra can be installed on a single machine or in a docker container, and it works well
 * for basic testing. A single Cassandra instance is called a node.
 *
 * The design goal of Cassandra is to handle big data workloads across multiple nodes without
 * any single point of failure. Cassandra has peer-to-peer distributed system across its nodes,
 * and data is distributed among all the nodes in a cluster.

 *
 * @MongoDB is a CP data storeâ€”it resolves network partitions by maintaining consistency,
 * while compromising on availability.
 * MongoDb uses master slave architecture.
 *
 * How does MongoDB ensure consistency?
 * MongoDB is consistent by default: reads and writes are issued to the primary member of a replica set.
 * Applications can optionally read from secondary replicas, where data is eventually consistent by default.
