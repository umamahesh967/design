/**
 * Below 12 are non-functional requirements for System Design.
 *
 * 1.Performance
 * - performance measures how effective is a software system with respect to time constraints and allocation of resources
 *
 * 2.Interoperability
 * - the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information.
 *
 * 3.Usability
 * - refers to how easily a user interacts with a website or product.
 *
 * 4.Reliability (the quality of being trustworthy or of performing consistently well.)
 * - is an attribute of the system responsible for the ability to continue to operate under predefined conditions.
 *
 * 5.Availability
 * - is part of reliability and is expressed as the ratio of the available system time to the total working time.
 *
 * 6.Security
 *  - is responsible for the ability of the system to reduce the likelihood of malicious or accidental actions as well as the possibility of theft or loss of information.
 *
 * 7.Maintainability
 * - is the ability of the system to support changes.
 *
 * 8.Modifiability
 * - determines how many common changes need to be made to the system to make changes to each individual item.
 *
 * 9.Testability
 * - shows how well the system allows performing tests, according to predefined criteria.
 *
 * 10.Scalability
 * - is the ability of the system to handle load increases without decreasing performance, or the possibility to rapidly increase the load.
 *
 * 11.Reusability
 * - is a chance of using a component or system in other components/systems with small or no change.
 *
 * 12.Supportability
 * - is the ability of the system to provide useful information for identifying and solving problems.
 *
 * 13.Error Handling
 * - If some thing goes wrong how the product handles those errors.
