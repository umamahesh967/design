 * Consensus algorithm is strategy that a group of computer use to agree between each other on what is true.
 * There different flavours of consensus algorithm that people have applied that each have different properties or
 * tradeoffs in terms of how secure the agreement is and who gets to vote on what.
 * In general the consensus algorithm is just to manage which participants in the network get to set the state of truth that
 * everyone in the network agrees and follows on.
 *
 * Benefits of consensus algorithm is
 * The most significant benefit of consensus algorithm is it's decentralized. So you don't have to trust any one person to
 * keep the state of truth to the system. And there is no one person who can admit or restrict anybody else from participating
 * in the system.
