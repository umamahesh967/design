 * We can distinguish two categories of data replication protocols
 * 1.The first set of categories include  set of probabilistic protocols like Gossip, Epidemic Broadcast Trees,
 *   Bimodal Multicast. These protocols tend to favour eventual consistency.
 *
 * 2.The second category protocols include consensus protocols such as 2 or 3 phase commit, paxos,
 *   raft, chain replication. These protocols favour strong consistency.
